                        <blockquote>“[Ethiopia had] a status similar to that of Afghanistan, Persia, Japan, and Thailand as accepted anomalies in the imperialist world order."<small>Harold G. Marcus: A History of Ethiopia. University of California Press, 2002.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>Ethiopia is mentioned in the Bible and in ancient Greek literature, often as a metaphor for remoteness.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Mengistu and his men were building a people’s militia trained by North Korea and supplied by the Soviet Union, which the Derg had courted from the outset of its rule. Mengistu believed that the USSR’s revolutionary history of national reconstruction was more in keeping with Ethiopia’s political goals than were the traditions of American capitalism and bourgeois liberalism."<small> Harold G. Marcus: A History of Ethiopia. University of California Press, 2002.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Ethiopia in the late 1970s … internationalist cause célèbre … Soviet advisers … 13, 000 Cuban and 4, 000 South Yemeni soldiers … highly efficient, East German trained security services …"<small>Harold G. Marcus: A History of Ethiopia. University of California Press, 2002.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“America’s Vietnamese allies call the loss of their country Black April (Thang Tu Den). That phrase captured for them, in semi-poetic terms, the events that led to a modern-day Diaspora of nearly a million Vietnamese from their native land. The fall also sent several hundred thousand to prison, and condemned the remainder – some eighteen million people – to a life of poverty and loss of freedom. The Communists, not surprisingly, simply called it the Liberation of South Vietnam (Gai Phong Mien Nam)." <small>George J. Veith: Black April. The Fall of South Vietnam 1973-1975. Encounter Books, New York-London, 2012.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“Dazed, the Emperor trailed the five man outside and waited for his Mercedes. One of them motioned him to the back of a blue Volkswagen, and Emperor Haile Selassie needed no words to convey his contempt for the order, for the officers, for the treasonous plot. The shortest of the men, his movements spare and tightly coiled, pointed towards the car and swung the back door wider, his skittish eyes the only evidence of impatience. Under a rising sun furiously beating its way through clouds, the five stood, neatly ordered and stiff, sweating, waiting, then waiting some more until the old man finally slumped, defeated, and squeezed into the back of the small car." <small>Maaza Mengiste: Beneath the Lion’s Gaze. W.W. Norton & Company, New York-London, 2010.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>Hyenas are the most common, notorious predators of Ethiopia.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>"With the military junta ruling the roost, socialism became a buzzword, more fashionable than bell-bottom trousers and dog-ear-collar shirts. Communist literature, which no one had seen before, flooded the streets."<small>Nega Mezlekia: Notes from the Hyenas Belly.</small></blockquote>
                        <blockquote>"After buying the knife Gabra sent a photograph of herself and an anonymous typewritten note to the student newspaper. The note said: “Keep this picture. There will soon be a very juicy story involving the person in this picture."</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>“When Gabra was two, the Red Teror began – a time in which thirty thousand people were killed and massive numbers of others  disappeared and were tortured and imprisoned especially the educated elite. Corpses were dragged to their families doorsteps in the morning; the soldiers would force the families to pay for the bullet before relinquishing the bodies."</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>[Gabra] was a typical Ethiopian female, what ninety-five percent of Ethiopian parents want their daughters to be: not verbally opinionated, modest in clothing, gestures, behaviors and tone of voice, courteous, demure, doesn’t stand out in a crowd, follows rules, asks no questions.</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>A relative warned her: be careful in the States, “they have things like lesbians there”. In the village her father grew up in, such people were stoned. -----> unless they stated: homosexuality is a form of spirit possession</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>nlike lesbianism, for which is one responsible by Ethiopian standards, possession by spirits is regarded as a kind of casualty: it is common and curable in Ethiopia.</blockquote>

                        <p>Two girls. Two hard working emigrants in the mid-90s in New England. Students of an Ivy League College ready to conquer the Land of Free and fulfill their American Dream. To become doctors, to help on other people’s sufferings. To do good for the people of their new chosen country. Or go back to their old countries, where they are even more needed. They have similar life paths, similar backgrounds, though they are from faraway lands, different continents, very different cultures. Phuong is from Vietnam, a “boat people”, her father was an ARVN officer who died in a “re-education camp” after the Black April of 1975. Gabra is from the capital city of Ethiopia, raised during the most infamous era of her country, during the “Red Terror” of the Derg, a Communist military junta in the 70s and 80s. Her father spent time in jail as a political prisoner.</p>
                        <p>They are room mates in a dorm, their relationship is complicated, filled with culture shocks and affection, desires and sensuality, competition and disregard, alienation and unbalance. And – in the end – hatred. On Commencement Day’s dawn Gabra kills Phoung with 47 stabs. The world is perplexed.</p>
                        <p>There’s a third woman, Detective Dana Taylor. She tries to decipher the mystery. During this process she learns something about herself, too.</p>
